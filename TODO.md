- remove cargo install cargo-edit and cargo add json, ... from install guide
- use Event::Input or smt like that
- add command line args to make keyboard remember for:
  - window
  - app (all vim instances, ...)
  - window + children
- ? rewrite using async/await, as it is more propper way for this problem
